# Test Notifications Implementation Summary

## What I've Implemented

### 1. **Fixed the Exact Alarm Permission Issue**
- Changed `AndroidScheduleMode.exactAllowWhileIdle` to `AndroidScheduleMode.inexactAllowWhileIdle`
- This resolves the "Exact alarms are not permitted" error you were seeing in the logs
- Added proper error handling for notification scheduling

### 2. **Added Test Notifications for 7:30, 7:31, 7:32 AM**
- **7:30 AM**: Task Reminder Test notification
- **7:31 AM**: Dhikr Reminder Test notification  
- **7:32 AM**: Dua Reminder Test notification

### 3. **Enhanced Timezone Handling**
- Properly uses device's local timezone
- Logs current device time and timezone
- Ensures notifications are scheduled based on device time

### 4. **New Features Added**

#### **Automatic Scheduling**
- Test notifications are automatically scheduled when the app starts
- They will be scheduled for the next occurrence of 7:30, 7:31, 7:32 AM

#### **Manual Control Buttons**
- **"Schedule Test Notifications (7:30, 7:31, 7:32 AM)"** - Purple button to manually schedule
- **"Cancel Test Notifications"** - Orange button to cancel the test notifications

#### **Smart Time Handling**
- If the test times have already passed today, it will schedule for tomorrow
- If it's before 7:30 AM today, it will schedule for today
- Proper logging shows when notifications are scheduled or if times have passed

## How to Test

### 1. **Immediate Testing**
1. Open the app
2. Go to Settings > Notifications
3. Click "Schedule Test Notifications (7:30, 7:31, 7:32 AM)"
4. You should see a success message
5. Check the console logs for confirmation

### 2. **Wait for Notifications**
- If it's before 7:30 AM: Wait for the notifications to appear at 7:30, 7:31, 7:32 AM
- If it's after 7:32 AM: The notifications will be scheduled for tomorrow

### 3. **Test with App Closed**
1. Schedule the test notifications
2. Close the app completely
3. Wait for the scheduled times
4. Notifications should appear even with the app closed

### 4. **Cancel Test Notifications**
- Use the "Cancel Test Notifications" button to remove the scheduled test notifications

## Notification Details

### **7:30 AM - Task Reminder Test**
- Title: "ðŸ§ª Task Reminder Test"
- Body: "This is a test notification for Islamic tasks reminder"
- Uses task reminder notification styling (green color)

### **7:31 AM - Dhikr Reminder Test**
- Title: "ðŸ§ª Dhikr Reminder Test"
- Body: "This is a test notification for dhikr reminder"
- Uses dhikr reminder notification styling (blue color)

### **7:32 AM - Dua Reminder Test**
- Title: "ðŸ§ª Dua Reminder Test"
- Body: "This is a test notification for dua reminder"

## Technical Implementation

### **Notification IDs**
- Task Test: ID 5001
- Dhikr Test: ID 5002
- Dua Test: ID 5003

### **Scheduling Method**
```dart
await _notifications.zonedSchedule(
  5001 + i, // Unique IDs
  title,
  body,
  tz.TZDateTime.from(scheduledTime, tz.local), // Uses device timezone
  details,
  androidScheduleMode: AndroidScheduleMode.inexactAllowWhileIdle, // Fixed permission issue
  uiLocalNotificationDateInterpretation: UILocalNotificationDateInterpretation.absoluteTime,
  payload: 'test_${type}_reminder',
);
```

### **Timezone Handling**
- Automatically detects device timezone
- Logs current device time and timezone
- Ensures notifications are scheduled in local time

### **Error Handling**
- Try-catch blocks around each notification scheduling
- Detailed logging for debugging
- User-friendly error messages in the UI

## Expected Behavior

âœ… **No More Permission Errors**: The "exact_alarms_not_permitted" error should be resolved
âœ… **Test Notifications Work**: You should receive 3 test notifications at the specified times
âœ… **Background Operation**: Notifications should work even when the app is closed
âœ… **Manual Control**: You can schedule and cancel test notifications as needed
âœ… **Proper Logging**: Console will show when notifications are scheduled or if times have passed
âœ… **Device Timezone**: Notifications will be scheduled based on your device's local time

## Troubleshooting

If test notifications don't work:

1. **Check Device Settings**: Ensure notifications are enabled for the app
2. **Check Time**: Make sure it's before 7:32 AM or wait for tomorrow
3. **Use Manual Button**: Try the "Schedule Test Notifications" button
4. **Check Logs**: Look for error messages in the console
5. **Try Immediate Test**: Use "Send Test Notification" for immediate testing
6. **Check Timezone**: Verify the console shows your correct device timezone

The test notifications will help you verify that the notification system is working properly and that the fixes I implemented are effective!
